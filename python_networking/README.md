# python network programming
The goal of this project is to acquire a deeper understanding of netowrk programming. It 
follows the book [Foundations of Python Network Programming book, Third Edition]
(https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/fopnp) by Brandon Rhodes, John Goerzen. Comments and 
updates are made by me. Belows are just some notes that I keep for myself.

### `virtualenv`
- Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv â€“p python3 env_name`
- Change directory to that folder: `cd env_name`
- Activate virtual environment: `. bin/activate`
- Install dependency as normal: `pip install module_name`
- Import module: `python -c 'import module_name'`
